  <li><strong>Other Tools:</strong> Various pliers, screwdrivers, tweezers, and clamps are used for wire management, holding components, or adjusting small parts.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#ffcc00; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Understanding the purpose of each tool is essential for safe and efficient electrical work.</p>
`
,
  ohms: `
<h1>Ohms & Resistors</h1>
<p>Understanding Ohms and resistors is key to building safe and effective electrical circuits on your robot.</p>

<h2>What is Ohm (Ω)?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ohm (Ω) is the unit of electrical resistance. It measures how much a component resists the flow of electric current.</li>
  <li>Voltage (V) is the “pressure” pushing current through a circuit, while Ohms resist that flow.</li>
  <li>Current (I) is the actual flow of electricity. Ohm’s Law connects all three: <strong>V = I × R</strong> (Voltage = Current × Resistance).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resistors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Resistors are components that limit or control the flow of electrical current in a circuit.</li>
  <li>They are used to protect electronics, adjust signal levels, or create desired current flows for sensors and LEDs.</li>
  <li>Resistors are labeled with their resistance value (in Ohms) and tolerance (accuracy).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding Resistor Values</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A resistor marked <strong>1000Ω 5%</strong> means it has a nominal resistance of 1000 Ohms with a tolerance of ±5%.</li>
  <li>Tolerance shows how much the actual resistance can vary from the stated value (e.g., a 1000Ω 5% resistor could be anywhere from 950Ω to 1050Ω).</li>
  <li>Resistor values are often identified by colored bands. Each color corresponds to a number that helps calculate the resistance value.</li>
  <li>Example: A resistor with bands brown-black-red-gold = 1 (brown), 0 (black), ×100 (red), ±5% (gold) = 1000Ω ±5%.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Ohms & Resistors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Measure voltage across a resistor to calculate current using Ohm’s Law.</li>
  <li>Use resistors to limit current to LEDs, sensors, or other sensitive electronics.</li>
  <li>Check resistors with a multimeter to ensure they match the expected value before installing.</li>
  <li>Resistors are essential for safe and functional circuits, preventing damage from excess current.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#ffcc00; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Knowing Ohms, voltage, and current helps you design, test, and troubleshoot circuits effectively and safely.</p>
`
,
  fuses: `
<h1>Fuses in the PDH</h1>
<p>Fuses are essential components in the Power Distribution Hub (PDH) that protect individual circuits from overcurrent or faults. Each fuse is designed to blow if too much current flows through a specific branch, preventing damage to motors, sensors, or other electronics.</p>

<h2>Purpose of Fuses</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Protect individual branch circuits in the PDH from overcurrent.</li>
  <li>Prevent damage to electronics by stopping excess current before it reaches sensitive components.</li>
  <li>Work together with the main breaker: the main breaker protects the entire system, while fuses protect individual circuits.</li>
  <li>Make troubleshooting easier: if a fuse blows, you know exactly which branch circuit is experiencing a problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Handling & Safety</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Always use the correct fuse rating for each PDH branch circuit. Using the wrong rating can fail to protect the circuit or cause nuisance trips.</li>
  <li>Do not bypass fuses or replace them with wire; this defeats safety and can cause serious damage.</li>
  <li>Inspect fuses regularly for discoloration, melting, or corrosion.</li>
  <li>Turn off the main breaker before replacing or checking fuses.</li>
  <li>Verify polarity and proper seating in the PDH to ensure the fuse functions correctly.</li>
  <li>After replacing a fuse, test the circuit with a multimeter for continuity and proper current flow before powering the robot.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#ffcc00; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Proper use and handling of fuses ensure safe, reliable, and protected operation of your robot’s electrical system.</p>
`
,
 battery: `
<h1>Battery Handling</h1>
<p>Batteries are heavy and store a lot of energy, so proper handling is extremely important to keep yourself and the robot safe. Follow these steps carefully whenever working with batteries.</p>

<h2>Checking Battery Status</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use a Battery Beak to check the battery connections and status. Press the button <strong>twice</strong> to see the result.</li>
  <li>The Beak will show: <strong>Good</strong>, <strong>Fair</strong>, or <strong>Bad</strong>.</li>
  <li>130% means the battery is full and in good condition.</li>
  <li>The Battery Beak is mainly for checking battery health and charge level, not for current flow.</li>
  <li>Use a multimeter to check that current is actually flowing, as well as voltage and Ohms readings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safe Connection Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Never grab wires from the wire plugs; always handle the battery itself.</li>
  <li>If you see exposed wires or copper, tape them: <strong>Red for +</strong> and <strong>Black for –</strong>.</li>
  <li>Plug batteries into the charger, <strong>never into another battery</strong>.</li>
  <li>Do not unplug the battery while the robot is on. Always turn off the robot first.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Handling and Safety</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Treat batteries with care—they are heavy and can cause injury or damage if dropped.</li>
  <li>Be observant when connecting and disconnecting batteries to avoid short circuits or damage.</li>
  <li>Double-check connections and wiring, making sure crimps are secure and wires are properly routed.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#ffcc00; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Proper battery handling ensures safety, prevents damage, and keeps your robot powered and ready for competition.</p>
`
,
 breaker: `
<h1>Main Breaker, PDH & Fuses</h1>
<p>The main breaker, Power Distribution Hub (PDH), and fuses are the backbone of your robot’s electrical safety system. They work together to distribute power and protect your robot’s electronics from damage due to overloads, short circuits, or other faults.</p>

<h2>Key Functions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Main Breaker:</strong> The primary power switch between the battery and the robot. It allows quick shutdown and protects the system from major overloads.</li>
  <li><strong>PDH:</strong> Receives power from the battery through the main breaker and distributes it to multiple smaller circuits for motors, sensors, and controllers. Many PDHs include status LEDs or diagnostic indicators.</li>
  <li><strong>Fuses:</strong> Installed in each branch circuit of the PDH to prevent excessive current from damaging motors, sensors, or other components. If a fault occurs in one branch, the fuse will blow and protect the rest of the system.</li>
  <li>The main breaker and fuses complement each other: the main breaker protects the overall system, while fuses protect individual circuits from overcurrent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How They Work Together</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Power flows from the battery → main breaker → PDH → branch circuits.</li>
  <li>If a motor stalls or a short occurs in one branch, the fuse will blow, preventing damage to the rest of the system.</li>
  <li>If the entire system draws too much current (like a major short), the main breaker will trip to protect the battery and wiring.</li>
  <li>Both devices ensure that electrical faults do not cause overheating, fire, or permanent damage to components.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety Hazards & Handling</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Always use the correct wire gauge from battery to main breaker to PDH and to branch circuits. Undersized wires can overheat.</li>
  <li>Never bypass fuses or use an incorrectly rated fuse; this defeats the safety system.</li>
  <li>Check polarity and secure connections; positive to positive, negative to negative.</li>
  <li>Keep the main breaker accessible for emergency shutdown.</li>
  <li>Inspect PDH and fuses regularly for melted insulation, discoloration, or loose connections.</li>
  <li>Do not attempt to remove or replace fuses while the robot is powered; turn off the main breaker first.</li>
  <li>Be aware that high-current faults can cause sparks, heat, or molten metal—even at 12V systems—so handle with care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Team Checklist</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Label and verify accessibility of the main breaker.</li>
  <li>Check wiring from battery → main breaker → PDH → fuses is correctly sized and routed.</li>
  <li>Verify each PDH branch circuit has the correct fuse installed and functioning.</li>
  <li>Inspect for signs of overheating or damage before powering on the robot.</li>
  <li>Test subsystems under load and monitor for unusual heating, sparks, or voltage drops.</li>
  <li>Document all breaker and fuse ratings for inspection and reference.</li>
  <li>After repairs or modifications, re-examine all connections before applying power.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#ffcc00; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">The main breaker, PDH, and fuses work together to keep your robot safe, reliable, and ready for competition.</p>

,
  recheck: `
<h1>Rechecking Connections</h1>
<p>Rechecking connections is an essential step to ensure that all wiring and components on the robot are secure and functioning properly. This process helps prevent electrical failures during competitions and ensures that power and signals reach all critical parts of the robot.</p>

<h2>Why Rechecking Connections is Important</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensures that all wires and connections allow proper current flow.</li>
  <li>Helps identify faulty connections before matches or testing.</li>
  <li>Status lights on components give a quick visual indication of any issues.</li>
  <li>Using a multimeter verifies that current can flow and connections are electrically sound.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Visual Inspection and Status Lights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Look at status lights on all components to quickly detect errors or disconnected devices.</li>
  <li>Check for loose wires, improperly seated connectors, or damaged crimps.</li>
  <li>Secure wires with zip ties to maintain stability and organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Tug-Test Important Wires</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gently pull on critical wires, such as power or sensor cables, to ensure they are firmly attached.</li>
  <li>Focus on connections to the RoboRIO, PDP, and motor controllers, as these are key components.</li>
  <li>Be careful not to pull too hard to avoid damaging connectors or crimps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Using a Multimeter to Verify Connections</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Set the multimeter to continuity or Ohms (Ω) mode.</li>
  <li>Touch the probes to each end of a wire or connection to confirm current can flow.</li>
  <li>A beep or near-zero resistance confirms a good connection.</li>
  <li>If the reading is high or no continuity is detected, the wire, connector, or solder joint may be faulty.</li>
  <li>Check hard-to-reach areas, such as inside swerve drives or under motor controllers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Checking Connectors and Crimps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure all male and female connectors are inserted correctly; misalignment can prevent current flow.</li>
  <li>Verify crimps for solid connections; poorly crimped wires are a common source of electrical failure.</li>
  <li>Re-crimp or resolder connections if needed for reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5: Verify Key Components</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Double-check PDP connections, as loose connections here can affect the entire robot.</li>
  <li>Check RoboRIO connections; faulty inputs can cause significant issues during operation.</li>
  <li>Organize wires with zip ties to prevent strain and maintain stability in tight areas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Perform connection checks regularly, especially before competitions or testing sessions.</li>
  <li>Combine visual inspection, tug-tests, and multimeter verification for thorough checks.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to hidden or hard-to-access wiring to ensure nothing is missed.</li>
  <li>Label and organize wires to make troubleshooting easier and faster.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#ffcc00; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Regularly rechecking connections, monitoring status lights, and maintaining organized wiring ensures your robot is safe, reliable, and ready for competition.</p>

  crimping: `<h1>Crimping</h1><p>Use the correct crimping tool and connector size...</p>`,
 soldering: `
<h1>Soldering</h1>
<p>Soldering is an essential skill for building reliable electrical connections on our FRC robots. Done correctly, soldering ensures strong, neat, and long-lasting joints. This tutorial covers everything you need to know, including preparation, techniques, tools, and safety precautions.</p>

<h2>Tools and Equipment</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Soldering iron:</strong> Heats up (usually takes ~1 minute) and does <strong>not have adjustable temperature</strong>. Wait until it reaches full heat before soldering.</li>
  <li><strong>Solder wire:</strong> For connecting wires; use rosin-core solder for electronics.</li>
  <li><strong>Flux:</strong> Applied before tinning wires to help solder spread evenly. Think of flux as glue—it ensures solder sticks better and flows more easily. <strong>Do not use expired flux</strong> as it may fail or damage connections.</li>
  <li><strong>Wire strippers:</strong> For safely removing insulation from wire ends.</li>
  <li><strong>Wire cutters:</strong> Cut wires slightly longer than needed for precise work.</li>
  <li><strong>Helping hands / Kotto extra hands:</strong> Hold wires in place to prevent burns and allow precise soldering.</li>
  <li><strong>Magnifying lamp (optional):</strong> Provides better visibility for small or delicate wires.</li>
  <li><strong>Vacuum fume extractor:</strong> Removes solder smoke, which is a safety hazard.</li>
  <li><strong>Solder sucker (optional):</strong> Removes excess solder if necessary, mainly used for correcting mistakes.</li>
  <li><strong>Sponge:</strong> Wet before soldering to clean the soldering iron tip. <strong>Do not leave dry</strong> — placing a hot iron on a dry sponge may start a fire.</li>
  <li><strong>Metallic scraper:</strong> Used to scrape off excess solder.</li>
  <li><strong>Heat shrink tubing:</strong> Slide onto wires <strong>before soldering</strong> to cover exposed copper after soldering for safety.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety glasses:</strong> Protect your eyes from hot solder splashes.</li>
  <li><strong>Gloves (optional):</strong> Protect hands from heat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare Your Wires</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Strip the ends of the wires using wire strippers. Keep stripped lengths equal for neat connections.</li>
  <li>Slide heat shrink tubing onto the wire before soldering.</li>
  <li>Do not “birdy cage” the ends (twisting stripped ends together). This creates weak joints.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Apply Flux</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Apply a small amount of flux to the stripped ends. It spreads solder evenly and helps adhesion.</li>
  <li>Use fresh, unexpired flux to avoid failed connections or damage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Tinning the Wires</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Heat the soldering iron until fully hot (~1 minute, depends on the iron).</li>
  <li>Lightly melt solder onto each fluxed wire end, coating it evenly. This is called tinning.</li>
  <li>Even tinned wires make joining easier and more precise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Position the Wires</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Align wires tip-to-tip with equal exposed lengths.</li>
  <li>Do not twist together (no birdy-caging).</li>
  <li>Use helping hands to hold wires; gloves if holding by hand.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5: Solder the Joint</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Place the soldering iron on the joint and let tinned solder flow together.</li>
  <li>The solder should form a shiny, even joint.</li>
  <li>If the joint needs adjustment, carefully remelt the solder to reposition or add more solder.</li>
  <li>Use the solder sucker only to remove solder if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 6: Apply Heat Shrink</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Slide the heat shrink tubing over the joint.</li>
  <li>Use heat to shrink it snugly around the soldered wire for insulation and safety.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 7: Inspect and Clean</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Check the joint is smooth, shiny, and fully covered.</li>
  <li>Look for cold joints (dull, cracked, uneven solder) and reheat if necessary.</li>
  <li>Clean the soldering iron on a wet sponge; use metallic scraper if excess solder remains.</li>
  <li>Wash hands after soldering, especially if flux touched your skin.</li>
  <li>Turn off and store the soldering iron safely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety Tips and Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Always wear safety glasses.</li>
  <li>Use the vacuum fume extractor to avoid inhaling smoke.</li>
  <li>Do not hold wires directly near the hot soldering iron; heat spreads quickly.</li>
  <li>Magnifying lamps are optional but helpful.</li>
  <li>Helping hands prevent burns and make soldering stable.</li>
  <li>Keep workspace organized to avoid accidents.</li>
  <li>Never leave a hot soldering iron on a dry sponge; it can start a fire.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#ffcc00; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Following these steps ensures strong, clean, and safe solder joints. Proper technique keeps both you and the robot safe, while producing professional-quality work.</p>

 sensors: `
<h1>Sensors & CAN Bus</h1>
<p>Sensors and the CAN (Controller Area Network) bus are essential for your robot to understand its environment and communicate between devices.</p>

<h2>What is CAN Bus?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>CAN Bus is a communication network that allows devices (like motor controllers, sensors, and the RoboRIO) to send and receive data over the same wires.</li>
  <li>It transports commands and feedback between the RoboRIO and components. Essentially, it “talks” and sends code/data to devices so they operate correctly.</li>
  <li>All CAN devices have unique IDs. Proper ID assignment is critical to avoid conflicts.</li>
  <li>CAN wires are usually twisted pairs for signal integrity and noise reduction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Sensors</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Range Sensors:</strong> Detect distance to objects (e.g., ultrasonic or LiDAR). Useful for autonomous navigation or collision avoidance.</li>
  <li><strong>Color Sensors:</strong> Detect the color of game pieces or field markings. Often used for sorting or game logic in autonomous mode.</li>
  <li><strong>Gyros/Encoders:</strong> Track robot rotation, speed, or position. Critical for precise driving and motion control.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CAN Device Status & LED Indicators</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Many CAN devices have LEDs showing connection or error status.</li>
  <li>Typical LED colors:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Green:</strong> Device powered and communicating correctly.</li>
    <li><strong>Red:</strong> Error or fault detected.</li>
    <li><strong>Yellow/Orange:</strong> Warning, device connected but not fully operational or pending initialization.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Check LED colors before powering the robot to ensure all sensors and CAN devices are functioning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practices for CAN & Sensors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Verify all connections are secure—loose wires can cause intermittent communication errors.</li>
  <li>Keep CAN wires tidy and away from high-power wires to avoid interference.</li>
  <li>Use proper termination resistors on the CAN bus if required to prevent signal reflections.</li>
  <li>Test each sensor individually with the RoboRIO to confirm it responds correctly before integrating into the full robot system.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#ffcc00; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Proper setup of sensors and CAN devices ensures accurate data, reliable communication, and safe robot operation.</p>

  multimeter: `
<h1>Using a Multimeter</h1>
<p>A multimeter is one of the most essential tools for any electrical subteam member. It allows you to check if connections are solid, resistances are correct, and current can flow through wires and components safely. Proper use ensures all components, including batteries, are healthy and wired correctly, preventing failures during matches.</p>

<h2>Why Use a Multimeter</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Verify that battery connections are complete and current can flow properly through the terminals.</li>
  <li>Check wire connections to ensure soldering and crimps are solid and continuous.</li>
  <li>Test resistor connections after soldering to confirm they are correctly installed and electrically functional.</li>
  <li>Detect damaged wires or poor connections early to prevent electrical issues on the robot.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing to Use a Multimeter</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Start with the multimeter turned off or on the correct measurement mode.</li>
  <li>Set the dial to the proper mode: <strong>Voltage (V)</strong> to check if a battery can supply voltage, <strong>Resistance/Ohms (Ω)</strong> to test connections, or <strong>Continuity</strong> to confirm current flow.</li>
  <li>Ensure probes are clean and properly connected: black to COM, red to V/Ω/A depending on what you’re measuring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checking Battery Health and Connections</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Set the multimeter to voltage or continuity mode.</li>
  <li>Place the probes on the battery terminals (black on negative, red on positive).</li>
  <li>A proper reading or beep indicates that current can flow and the battery connection is healthy.</li>
  <li>If the multimeter shows no voltage or no continuity, the battery may be disconnected, damaged, or faulty.</li>
  <li>Always check batteries before installing them on the robot to ensure they are safe and functional.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing Wire and Resistor Connections</h2>
<ul>
  <li>After soldering a resistor or wire, set the multimeter to Ohms (Ω) mode or continuity mode.</li>
  <li>Place the probes across the two ends of the connection.</li>
  <li>A near-zero resistance or a beep indicates a solid connection.</li>
  <li>High resistance or no continuity means the solder joint or wire may be faulty and needs to be fixed.</li>
  <li>Use this method for checking both battery connections and other critical wiring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Always confirm your multimeter is on the correct mode before measuring.</li>
  <li>Do not touch exposed wires or battery terminals while measuring to prevent short circuits.</li>
  <li>Check all new connections and batteries regularly to maintain robot reliability.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#ffcc00; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Using a multimeter correctly ensures all batteries and connections allow proper current flow, keeping your robot safe and performing reliably.</p>
